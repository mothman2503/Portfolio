		<P>The omlette, a plain and simple dish, is often viewed as the ultimate test of a Chef's culinary skill.
		<br><br>
		This plain, simple and seemingly pointless website, serves a similar function. Unlike the omlette, however, this website is not meant to be basic. On the contrary, it depicts all the fanciest things I can display as a web developer right now. This is my best sauce, and its in a spoon for you to taste. No bread. No meat. Nothing to go with it.
		<br><br>
		Without any real content to distract you from my job(designing a beautiful webpage), it strives to be an example of what I can acheive solely as a web designer and developer.
		<br><br>
		I do understand, however, that as a prospective client, you may want to see how I would display content relevant to your case. For this I have created <a href = "">the "Samples" page.</a> Feel free to visit the links provided there and go through any work I may have done thus far.
		<br><br>
		As I grow my skills, I shall continually update "The Plan" to display what I beleive represents the most generic form of what I can design based on my personal preferences, with my current skill-set. As mentioned earlier, for more case specific examples of my work, visit <a href = "">the "Samples" page.</a></p>
